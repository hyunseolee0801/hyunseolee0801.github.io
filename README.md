## 🧠 About Me
I'm a **Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University** specializing in **RF Engineering, Electromagnetics, and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) design**.  
I integrate electromagnetic modeling, neuroscience, and circuit design to explore how **electromagnetic energy interacts with the human brain**.

💡 *Interests:*  
- RF & Antenna Design (Ku-Band, ISM Band, GNSS)
- Neuro-stimulation (TMS, EEG, Neurophotonics)
- Hardware Automation with Python  
- RF Front-End Systems and PCB Design

## 🎯 Career Goals
I am currently seeking a **Summer 2026 internship** opportunity in **RF engineering, antenna design, or neurotechnology hardware**.  
My goal is to gain hands-on experience in advanced RF front-end design, test automation, and medical device systems that bridge **neuroscience and electromagnetics**. I am open to jobs that feature RFFE Design, Antenna Design and Test Automation.  

I plan to **graduate in Fall 2027** and am open to **full-time opportunities** that involve **RF circuit design, antenna arrays, biomedical instrumentation, or neurostimulation system development**.  
If your organization is developing next-generation RF systems or human-machine interfaces, I would love to contribute my skills and research background to your team.
