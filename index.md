## 🧠 About Me
I'm a **Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University** specializing in **RF Engineering, Electromagnetics, and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) design**.  
I integrate electromagnetic modeling, neuroscience, and circuit design to explore how **electromagnetic energy interacts with the human brain**. 
Currently, I am focusing on developing my skills in Analog / Mixed Circuit Design with goals of implementing this skill into neural engineering. 

💡 *Interests:*  
- RF & Antenna Design (Ku-Band, ISM Band, GNSS)
- Neuro-stimulation (TMS, EEG, Neurophotonics)
- Hardware Automation with Python  
- RF Front-End Systems and PCB Design

### Analog Neural Networks
Analog neural networks can substantially reduce, or even entirely eliminate, the necessity for analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog data conversion, as well as clock-driven logic. This, in turn, facilitates low-latency and contributes to a reduction in overall system complexity. Such advantages are of paramount importance in the development of wearable or implantable medical devices, where energy reserves are limited, and the physical size of the system is a critical design factor [31, 32].

Despite the evident merits of analog implementations, the design of effective and reliable analog neural networks continues to be a formidable undertaking. In contrast to digital models, where the functional behavior of the network is largely abstracted from the specifics of the underlying hardware, analog designs are intimately tied to the physical characteristics and inherent non-idealities of the circuit elements used to realize each computational operation [33, 34].
